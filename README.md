I have a standard way of setting up most projects I work on. This folder 
structure provides a quick template to get an empty solution working. When I am
less busy and lazy I will create a Visual Studio template for this. Then I can 
get a new project up with this structure just by creating a new solution.

Maybe worthwhile to have gitignore and settings.stylecop as nuget packages. Then
I can maintain them in a central location and include them on any project I'm 
working on. Just have to remember if I use the nuget way, not to update or I will
loose all customizations that I make for a project.
