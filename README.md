This started as a standard way of setting up most projects I work on. The folder 
structure provides a quick template to get an empty solution working. When I am
less busy and lazy I will create a Visual Studio template for this. Then I can 
get a new project up with this structure just by creating a new solution.

I also started on some core interfaces and infrastructure that is common across
projects. The goal is that I can include these projects and get the base core
architecture without having to rewrite it. There is still a lot to do. I am a
big fan of the [Onion Architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) and 
the goal of this little project is to eventually grown into an implementation of
Onion.

I guess I should explain the name. My wife's nick name is Dutchess. She likes to
watch this crazy cartoon named Archer and the main character, Archer, his code
name is Dutchess. So, my wife says that her code name is Archer. Well Archer kind
of reminds me of architecture so it was only natural to name it Archer and the
code name of the first release is Dutchess...make sense right?
